# Algorithm

1. Consider an array of integers a. Let min(a) be its minimal element, and let avg(a) be its mean.Define the center of the array a as array b such that:
    1. b is formed from a by erasing some of its elements.
    2. For each i, |b[i] - avg(a)| < min(a).
    3. b has the maximum number of elements among all the arrays satisfying the above requirements.
    4. Given an array of integers, return its center.
